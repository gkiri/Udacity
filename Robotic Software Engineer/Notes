1.Xacro files are just sub files or modules of URDF file .Since URDF is very big we divide each modulesa
as one xacro file to make it easy to read and implement

2. Generally box ,cylinder shapes etc basic shapes are done in links and joints.
But to get complex shapes like Lidar with good texture we go with mesh files specially designed

Those files are .dae files

eg:Hokyo.dae is mesh file of hokyo lidar shape to import in to xacro file 

3.How we add .dae in xacro file 
eg:geometry for <visual> - filename = “package://my_robot/meshes/hokuyo.dae”

1.Plugins link between sensors we added  to simulation.so that we capture data from sensors in gayebo simulation.

    Eg:<plugin name="differential_drive_controller" filename="libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so">
    libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so is the shared object file created from compiling the C++ source code. 
    The plugin accepts information specific to your robot's model, such as wheel separation, 
    joint names, and more. Then it calculates and publishes the robot's odometry information to 
    the topics that you specified, like odom.

2.But how exactly does the camera sensor takes those images in simulation?
 How does a lidar sensor take laser measurements in simulation?
 How exactly does your robot move in a simulated environment?

we need now for project 2 3 Plugins
    A plugin for the camera sensor.
    A plugin for the Hokuyo lidar sensor.
    A plugin for the wheel joints actuator.

3.ALl plugins add in .gazebo file and place this file under /urdf folder

Rviz

1. RViz is a ROS package, it requires roscore. In a terminal spin up roscore:
2.RViz is our one-stop tool to visualize all three core aspects of a robot: perception, decision-making, and actuation.
