1.Xacro files are just sub files or modules of URDF file .Since URDF is very big we divide each modulesa
as one xacro file to make it easy to read and implement

2. Generally box ,cylinder shapes etc basic shapes are done in links and joints.
But to get complex shapes like Lidar with good texture we go with mesh files specially designed

Those files are .dae files

eg:Hokyo.dae is mesh file of hokyo lidar shape to import in to xacro file 

3.How we add .dae in xacro file 
eg:geometry for <visual> - filename = “package://my_robot/meshes/hokuyo.dae”


Gazebo Plugins

1.Plugins link between sensors we added  to simulation.so that we capture data from sensors in gayebo simulation.

2.But how exactly does the camera sensor takes those images in simulation?
 How does a lidar sensor take laser measurements in simulation?
 How exactly does your robot move in a simulated environment?

we need now for project 2 3 Plugins
    A plugin for the camera sensor.
    A plugin for the Hokuyo lidar sensor.
    A plugin for the wheel joints actuator.
